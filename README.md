# IOT_Project

## summary

This IoT project is designed to test our skill in understanding, and developing, IoT-based devices and applications. We will do so in a way that is correct, modular, and maintainable. We will use and learn about multiple technologies during this project. The aim of this project is to make the pynq board into a IoT device that uses openremote to visualize the data the pynq board recives/makes. In this project we will be making use of Docker and openremote as well as Github.

## Pynq

PYNQ (Python Productivity for ZYNQ) is an open-source project from Xilinx that makes it easy to design embedded systems with Xilinx Zynq Systems on Chips (SoCs). The PYNQ board is based on the Zynq SoC, which contains a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor and an FPGA fabric. The board is designed to be programmed using Python, which allows developers to take advantage of the high-level programming language to create embedded systems with a high degree of flexibility and control. PYNQ also provides a library of pre-built overlay IP that allow users to easily add hardware-accelerated functions like video processing, image processing, and machine learning to their designs.
